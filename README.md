# ðŸ§¬ Normalization of RNA-Seq data using adaptive trimmed mean with multi-reference

This project compares various normalization methods for RNA-seq differential expression (DE) analysis on **Sequencing quality control project (SEQC)**, **Microarray quality control project dataset (MAQC)** **Pickrell dataset** (`SRP001540`) from the `recount` project and two Simulated datasets. Multiple normalization strategies are applied, and performance is evaluated using ROC curves.
